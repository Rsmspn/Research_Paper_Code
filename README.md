# Research_Paper_Code
Code used in our research paper "Handwritten Digit Recognition".
So we have conducted a research on different architectures of the CNN model in our reserach. The four architecture which we have used are :-
1. CNN
2. ConvNet
3. LeNet-5
4. ResNet
So Based on our research the code which we have used is store in the above files.
